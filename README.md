# Predicting Price Moves with News Sentiment — Week 1

This repo contains work for the 10 Academy Week 1 challenge: analyzing the relationship between news headline sentiment and stock price movements.

Structure:

- `progress.md` — tracker for tasks and activity log.
- `src/` — source code and analysis scripts.
- `notebooks/` — exploratory notebooks.
- `data/` — (not committed) place your datasets here.

How I will work:
- Create branches for each major task (e.g., `task-1`, `task-2`, `task-3`).
- Commit frequently and document findings in `progress.md`.
